# **Session 6 - Agentic Architecture**

This session moves the agent from one file to four named cognitive roles. The agent that emerged in Session 5 as `[agent5.py](agent5.py)` carried perception, planning, dispatch, and verification inside a single monolithic loop. The loop worked. It is also the limit of what a single LLM call can be asked to do reliably as queries grow more complex. Session 6 redesigns the agent around typed contracts between four roles: **Memory**, **Perception**, **Decision**, and **Action**. The four roles communicate through Pydantic models, and the substrate underneath them is the LLM gateway built in Session 5 (now upgraded to **V3**).

The thesis of this session is structural. A loop becomes an architecture when each role has a typed input, a typed output, and one job. The architectural payoff appears later in the course: **Session 7** expands Memory into a three-tier system, **Session 8** replaces the loop with a **DAG**, and later sessions promote Perception into a fully fledged **Planner Agent**. The four roles defined here are the vocabulary that survives all of those upgrades. The composition changes; the role names persist.

The architectural lessons in this session are exercised by four target queries that you will implement and verify in your assignment. Those four queries appear at the end of this document with worked traces. The agent in `[agent5.py](agent5.py)` cannot answer them reliably. The agent built here can.


## **A motivating example**

Consider the following user request, used as a recurring example in this session.

```
"Hey assistant, remind me to wish John on his birthday next week
 and also book a table for 2 near his office at 7 PM."
```

A single LLM call cannot handle this reliably. The query contains two independent goals, each with its own slots and ambiguities. "Next week" is a fuzzy date. "Near his office" assumes the agent knows John's office address. The booking has an exact time and party size. The reminder has a relative date and a recipient.

Run this through `[agent5.py](agent5.py)` and one of three failure modes appears. The planner solves the booking and forgets the reminder. The planner fuses both into a single calendar entry titled "John's birthday dinner at 7 PM." The planner takes three turns ping-ponging between the two goals because it cannot maintain state across them. Each failure is architectural rather than a debugging matter. The work the LLM is being asked to do at each step is too coarse for a single call to handle well.

The Session 6 architecture decomposes the work explicitly. **Perception** reads the query and emits a list of bounded goals with typed slots and surfaced ambiguities. **Decision** works on one goal at a time and never sees the other goals. **Memory** carries facts and outcomes across goals. **Action** runs MCP dispatches. The agent's main loop iterates over the goal list until Perception marks them all done.

The same architecture handles four broader query types in the assignment at the end of this session: extracting structured facts from a fetched web page, planning a weekend with weather as a constraint, persisting a preference across two separate runs, and synthesising findings from multiple sources.

# **The four cognitive roles**

The agent has **four** named roles. Each role is a responsibility, invoked in a specific order during each iteration of the main loop. The framing as responsibilities rather than as pipeline stages matters because the same role is invoked repeatedly across iterations and may be skipped within an iteration depending on what the prior role emitted.

| **Role** | **Responsibility** | **Invoked per iteration** | **LLM call?** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | A typed service that stores facts, preferences, tool outcomes, and scratchpad entries. Exposes `read(query, history)` and write methods. | Always called for `read`. Called by Action for `record_outcome`. | Only for the ambiguous classifying write. The keyword search read uses no LLM. |
| **Perception** | The orchestrator. Reads the query, the memory hits, and the history, and emits the current goal list with done flags and optional artifact attachments. | Yes, every iteration. | One LLM call routed via `auto_route="perception"` (pinned to Gemini in this session). |
| **Decision** | Picks the next action for one bounded goal. Returns either a final answer in plain text, or a single tool call to MCP. | Yes, once per iteration when there is an unfinished goal. | One LLM call routed via `auto_route="decision"`. |
| **Action** | Dispatches the chosen MCP tool. Pushes large results to the artifact store and returns a short descriptor. | Only when Decision returns a tool_call. | None. Pure dispatch. |

Two further components support the four roles.

## **Artifacts**

**Artifacts** is a content-addressable file store, kept parallel to Memory. Raw bytes that tools produce or fetch live in this store. Memory records the artifact handle and a short descriptor. Decision receives the raw bytes only when Perception explicitly attaches them.

## **The Gateway**

**The gateway** is the LLM gateway **V3** from Session 5. Every LLM call in the four roles routes through it. Perception calls go to Gemini through the gateway's `provider="g"` override. Decision and Memory calls use `auto_route` so the gateway's router pool selects the worker.

# **The Control Flow**

![Control Flowchart](./control_flow.png)

*This image above is a general flow, but still not fully multi-agent description.*

The main loop in `[agent.py](agent.py)` invokes the four roles in a fixed order each iteration. The diagram below shows one iteration.

![Control Flow per iteration](./control_flow2.png)

The loop terminates when Perception marks every goal as done.

Three properties of this flow deserve attention. First, Memory is consulted at the start of every iteration. The agent begins each iteration by asking what it already knows before doing any further work. Second, the attachment of artifact bytes to Decision's context is decided by Perception. Decision has no mechanism to request an artifact directly; Perception controls what Decision sees. Third, the Verifier role that lived as a separate LLM call in `[agent5.py](agent5.py)` is folded into Perception. Perception re-evaluates the goal list every iteration based on the history; a goal becomes `done` when Perception observes that the history contains a satisfying action.

## **The Pydantic contracts**

Every boundary between roles is a Pydantic model. The shapes are kept in `[schemas.py](schemas.py)`. The full set is small.

```
class MemoryItem(BaseModel):
    id: str
    kind: Literal["fact", "preference", "tool_outcome", "scratchpad"]
    keywords: list[str]
    descriptor: str            # one short human-readable line
    value: dict                # structured payload
    artifact_id: str | None    # handle into the artifact store
    source: str
    run_id: str
    goal_id: str | None
    confidence: float
    created_at: datetime


class Artifact(BaseModel):
    id: str                    # "art:<sha256-prefix>"
    content_type: str
    size_bytes: int
    source: str
    descriptor: str


class Goal(BaseModel):
    id: str
    text: str                  # short imperative description
    done: bool
    attach_artifact_id: str | None


class Observation(BaseModel):
    goals: list[Goal]


class ToolCall(BaseModel):
    name: str
    arguments: dict


class DecisionOutput(BaseModel):
    answer: str | None         # exactly one of these two is populated
    tool_call: ToolCall | None
```

The boundaries between roles are well typed. `[Memory.read](Memory.read)` returns `list[MemoryItem]`. `Perception.observe` returns `Observation`. `[Decision.next](Decision.next)``_step` returns `DecisionOutput`. `Action.execute` returns `tuple[str, str | None]` (descriptor, optional artifact id). The history that the loop accumulates is a list of plain dicts, but every event in the history mirrors one of these typed shapes.

Pydantic's role here is exactly the role it played in Session 5. The class is the schema, the validator at construction, the JSON Schema sent to the LLM in `response_format`, and the round-trip serialiser for persistence. The four roles in Session 6 each consume and produce instances of these models, so the boundary between roles is checked at every transition.

## **Memory as a typed service**

Memory in the Session 6 architecture is a service. Other roles invoke its `read` and `write` methods. The service sits beside the loop as an external store and is called when the loop or another role needs to consult it.

The V2 cohort's Memory layer was a list of strings with a `recall(query)` method that sent the entire list plus the query to an LLM. That implementation could not afford an LLM call per read and could not return more than one item at a time. Session 6's Memory implementation lifts both constraints. Reads are pure keyword search. Writes are typed.

**Kinds.** Memory items carry a `kind` discriminator with four legal values.

| **Kind** | **Carries** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| `fact` | A durable observed truth. | "John's office is HSR Layout, Bangalore." |
| `preference` | A user-stated or inferred preference. | "User prefers morning meetings." |
| `tool_outcome` | The record of one MCP dispatch. | "fetch_url(https://...) → artifact art:09ff..." |
| `scratchpad` | A run-scoped working note. | Intermediate planner state during the current run. |

The four kinds map onto the three-tier memory system that Session 7 introduces. The `fact` items become the Factual layer, the `preference` items become the REMME layer, and the `tool_outcome` items become the Episodic layer. The `scratchpad` is run-scoped and does not migrate. Session 6 keeps all four kinds in a single JSON file. Session 7 replaces the storage backend while preserving the read and write interfaces.

**Reads.** Three read methods cover the cases that arise in S6. Their cost profiles differ.

| **Method** | **What it does** | **LLM cost** |
|---|---|---|
| `[memory.read](memory.read)``(query, history, kinds=None, top_k=8)` | Keyword overlap across `keywords` plus tokens of `descriptor`. Returns ranked top-k. | None. Pure Python. |
| `memory.filter(kinds=..., goal_id=..., recent=N)` | Structured filter by kind, goal, recency. | None. |
| `memory.relevant(query, kinds=..., top_k=5)` | LLM-scored relevance over a kind-filtered candidate pool. Used only when keyword recall is weak. | One gateway call routed `auto_route="memory"`. |

The keyword search uses a small stopword list and a simple lowercase-token intersection. It scales to hundreds of items and stays fast enough to run before every Perception call. The implementation is short. We should be able to read it and understand the algorithm.

**Writes.** Two write methods cover the cases. Their cost profiles differ in the same way.

| **Method** | **When** | **LLM cost** |
|---|---|---|
| `memory.remember(raw_text, source, run_id, goal_id)` | Free-form ambiguous content (user input, observed statement). | One classification call (`auto_route="memory"`, pinned to Gemini). Returns a typed item with kind, keywords, descriptor, and structured value extracted by the LLM. |
| `memory.record_outcome(tool_call, result_text, artifact_id, ...)` | An MCP dispatch returned a result. | None. Kind is `tool_outcome` by construction; keywords come from tool name and argument tokens. |

The asymmetry matters. The LLM call at write time is what makes future reads cheap. When a user says "John's birthday is 15 May 2026," the classifier extracts the kind (`fact`), the canonical structure (`{"entity": "John", "attribute": "birthday", "value": "2026-05-15"}`), and a keyword list (`["John", "birthday", "May", "2026"]`). The keyword search at read time then finds this item with no LLM call. The Session 7 expansion will replace keyword search with hybrid retrieval (BM25 plus vector plus reciprocal rank fusion); the interface that `[Memory.read](Memory.read)` exposes to other layers does not change.

**Persistence.** All items live in a single JSON file at `state/memory.json`. The agent6 loop loads on first read and writes back after every mutation. Across runs, the same JSON file is reused, so preferences and facts persist. Clearing the file resets the agent.

## **Honest design notes.**

Three properties of Session 6 Memory are simplifications.

The Memory implementation in this session does not use embeddings. Keyword overlap is sufficient at the scale a single student's agent reaches. Session 7 introduces embedding-based retrieval and demonstrates the cases where keyword search fails (synonyms, multilingual queries, conceptually similar items that share no surface tokens). The Memory interface that we consume here is identical to the interface S7's implementation exposes, so the code that calls Memory survives the storage change.

Scratchpad as a separate kind is a small fiction. In a strict design, run-scoped working state would live in a separate object and Memory would persist only durable items. The four-kind unification gives us one interface to learn. The scratchpad disappears when the run completes; it is never read by future runs unless an LLM-classified write promotes a scratchpad item to a fact or preference.

Memory in Session 6 has no consolidation loop. A real production agent runs a background process that promotes scratchpad entries to facts when they recur, deduplicates facts that point to the same entity, and expires stale tool outcomes. Session 6 we see the raw record. The recurring assignment expects a clean `state/` directory between attempts.

# **Artifacts: the parallel store for raw bytes**

When a tool produces a payload larger than a few kilobytes, the bytes are written to a separate content-addressable store. Memory holds only the handle.

The distinction is load-bearing. A typical fetched web page is 100 KB or more (though lesser after the cleanup that we have already applied). If those bytes lived inside `MemoryItem.value`, every subsequent `[Memory.read](Memory.read)` would either return them (bloating Decision's context window) or excerpt them (forcing the loop to maintain a second piece of state about which excerpt to use). The artifact store sidesteps the choice by holding the bytes separately and giving Memory a handle.

```
class ArtifactStore:
    def put(self, blob: bytes, *,
            content_type: str, source: str, descriptor: str) -> str: ...
    def get_bytes(self, artifact_id: str) -> bytes: ...
    def get_meta(self, artifact_id: str) -> Artifact: ...
    def exists(self, artifact_id: str) -> bool: ...
```

Handles are short strings of the form `art:<sha256-prefix>`. Storage is two files per artifact under `state/artifacts/`: a `.bin` with the raw bytes and a `.json` with the metadata. The store is content-addressable; identical fetches deduplicate. The store has no eviction policy in S6.

The architectural boundary around artifacts is strict.

```
            ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │                                                      │
  Memory ◄──┤ holds the handle string ("art:abc...") inside        │
            │ MemoryItem.artifact_id                               │
            │                                                      │

            │                                                      │
  Decision ◄  sees the bytes only when Perception attaches them    │
            │ to the prompt for the current goal                   │
            │                                                      │

            │                                                      │
            └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

```

The boundary is enforced by the agent6 loop. Perception's output includes an optional `attach_artifact_id` field on each goal. When the next unfinished goal carries such a field, the loop calls `ArtifactStore.get_bytes(...)` and passes the result into Decision's prompt under an `ATTACHED ARTIFACTS:` section. Decision sees the section as part of its context window. The reason this matters is cost: a Decision call against a 4 KB context costs a fraction of one against a 200 KB context, and Decision should only pay the larger cost when the work it is doing on this turn requires the bytes.

# **Perception: the orchestrator**

Perception is the only role that maintains state across iterations. It runs every iteration. Each iteration, Perception receives four inputs: the user's original query, the current memory hits, the run history accumulated so far, and the prior goal list (the Observation it returned on the last iteration). Perception emits a fresh Observation containing the current goal list with done flags and optional artifact attachments.

```
def observe(
    query: str,
    hits: list[MemoryItem],
    history: list[dict],
    prior_goals: list[Goal],
    run_id: str,
) -> Observation: ...
```

The decomposition into goals happens the first time Perception runs (when `prior_goals` is empty). On every later iteration, Perception preserves the goal list shape and updates only the `done` flags and the `attach_artifact_id` on the next unfinished goal. This preserves identity across iterations: each goal occupies a stable position in the list, and the loop can refer to a goal by position without relying on the LLM to preserve identifiers.

The contract that Perception fulfills can be stated as four obligations.

```
1. If the prior goal list is empty, decompose the query into one or more
   bounded goals, each a short imperative statement.

2. For each prior goal, examine the run history. Mark the goal `done: true`
   the moment the history contains an action that satisfies it. Once done,
   the goal remains done in every subsequent iteration.

3. For the first unfinished goal in the list, decide whether it needs raw
   bytes from a previously fetched artifact. If yes, set the goal's
   attach_artifact_id to one of the artifact handles in MEMORY HITS.

4. Preserve goal order. Do not reorder, do not insert in the middle, do
   not drop a goal.
```

The implementation pins Perception to Gemini through the gateway's `provider="g"` field. The reason is observed empirically: when Perception is allowed to route through the gateway's normal TINY-tier worker (gpt-4.1-mini at the time of writing), the model is too small to reliably follow the procedure above. It hallucinates attachment ids, drops goals, and produces inconsistent identity across iterations. With Gemini selected explicitly, the procedure executes correctly across the four target queries.

Two structural choices in the prompt prevent hallucination from causing damage.

The first is positional identity. The Perception output schema does not include a goal id field. Goals are identified by their position in the output list. The outer loop carries the prior goal ids and maps them to the new positions. The model has no string field where it could invent a stale identifier.

The second is indexed artifact references. Memory hits are presented to Perception with an integer index `i` on each entry that carries an artifact. The model emits `artifact_index: <int>` rather than a string handle. The outer loop maps the integer back to the actual `art:...` handle. A model that wants to attach an artifact must point at one of the indices it actually sees.

Perception also subsumes the role that the structured-output Verifier played in Session 5. There is no separate Verifier call. When Perception re-reads the history at the start of each iteration, it observes whether the last action produced a result that satisfies the open goal, and it sets `done: true` accordingly. The reasoning that the Session 5 Verifier did inside a typed `Verdict` model is now done inside Perception's typed `Observation` model on every iteration.

# **Decision: one LLM call, two possible outputs**

Decision is the role that selects the next action. It receives one goal, the . memory hits, the recent history, optionally the raw bytes of an attached artifact, and the list of available MCP tools. It returns a `DecisionOutput` containing either a final answer in plain text or a single typed `ToolCall`. Decision does not pick more than one tool and does not narrate.

```
def next_step(
    goal: Goal,
    hits: list[MemoryItem],
    attached: list[tuple[str, bytes]],
    history: list[dict],
    mcp_tools: list[dict],
) -> DecisionOutput: ...
```

The shape of the call is exactly the shape that Session 5 introduced. The gateway is invoked with `tools=mcp_tools, tool_choice="auto"`. When the response contains `tool_calls[]`, Decision returns the first entry wrapped in a `ToolCall`. When the response contains only text, Decision returns the text as the answer.

The system prompt for Decision contains three substantive instructions.

The first is the choice itself: respond with exactly one of two outputs. Answer or call a tool. The model is not asked to do both.

The second is a rule about artifact handles. The model is told that strings beginning with `art:` are internal artifact handles. They reference the artifact store. The MCP tools accept real file paths and URLs as their arguments and reject the `art:` prefix at dispatch time. When a goal requires the bytes of an artifact, those bytes appear in the prompt under `ATTACHED ARTIFACTS:`. The model reads them there. This rule exists because TINY-tier models occasionally hallucinate that an artifact handle is something to pass to `read_file` or `fetch_url`. The Action layer also blocks this at dispatch time; the prompt instruction reduces wasted iterations.

The third is a rule about substantive answers. When the goal asks for an extraction, a list, a comparison, or a selection, the answer must be substantive: at least three sentences or a list of items. This rule exists to prevent the model from returning a meta-answer ("the page has been fetched, how would you like to proceed?") instead of doing the actual work the goal requires.

Decision routes through the gateway with `auto_route="decision"`. The router pool classifies the call and picks a tier. Most Decision calls land on the LARGE-tier Gemini model. Smaller Decision calls (planning a single tool dispatch from a short context) land on TINY-tier workers. The router decision is visible in the gateway's response under `router_decision`, and on the dashboard at port 8101.

# **Action: pure dispatch**

Action is the simplest role. It receives a `ToolCall` and a live MCP session, dispatches the call, and returns a tuple of `(descriptor, artifact_id_or_None)`.

```
async def execute(
    session: ClientSession,
    tool_call: ToolCall,
) -> tuple[str, str | None]: ...
```

Action contains no LLM call. The full logic is roughly thirty lines.

Three behaviours matter.

When the tool returns a payload larger than `ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (4 KB in this session), Action calls `ArtifactStore.put(...)` to persist the full bytes and returns a short descriptor of the form `[artifact art:abc..., 263507 bytes] preview: ...`. When the payload is smaller than the threshold, Action returns the text directly and no artifact is created.

When `tool_call.arguments` contains a `path` or `url` value that starts with `art:`, Action refuses the call and returns an error string explaining that artifact handles are not paths. This guard exists because TINY-tier Decision models occasionally pass an artifact handle to `read_file` or `fetch_url`. The guard blocks the dispatch and returns a clear error that the history records, so the next Perception iteration can mark the goal accordingly.

When the tool call is a real MCP dispatch, Action awaits `[session.call](session.call)``_tool(name, arguments=...)`, collapses the result's content blocks into a single text string, and proceeds with the threshold check.

The MCP server for Session 6 (in `mcp_``[server.py](server.py)`) exposes nine tools: `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `get_time`, `currency_convert`, `read_file`, `list_dir`, `create_file`, `update_file`, `edit_file`. The full inventory and contracts are documented in the server file itself. Decision sees these nine tools as a tool list and picks one when external work is required.


# **The agent loop in [agent.py](agent.py)**

The orchestrator in `[agent.py](agent.py)` ties the four roles together. The full loop fits on one screen.

```
async def run(query: str) -> str:
    ensure_gateway()
    run_id = uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]
    history: list[dict] = []
    prior_goals: list[Goal] = []

    # Durable memory: classify the user's query so facts/preferences
    # in it survive into future runs.
    memory.remember(query, source="user_query", run_id=run_id)

    async with mcp_session() as session:
        mcp_tools = await load_tools(session)
        tools = mcp_tools_for_decision(mcp_tools)

        for it in range(1, MAX_ITERATIONS + 1):
            hits = memory.read(query, history)
            obs = perception.observe(query, hits, history, prior_goals, run_id)
            prior_goals = obs.goals
            if obs.all_done:
                break

            goal = obs.next_unfinished()
            attached = []
            if goal.attach_artifact_id and artifacts.exists(goal.attach_artifact_id):
                attached.append((
                    goal.attach_artifact_id,
                    artifacts.get_bytes(goal.attach_artifact_id),
                ))

            out = decision.next_step(goal, hits, attached, history, tools)

            if out.is_answer:
                history.append({"iter": it, "kind": "answer",
                                "goal_id": goal.id, "text": out.answer})
                continue

            result_text, art_id = await action.execute(session, out.tool_call)
            memory.record_outcome(
                tool_call=out.tool_call,
                result_text=result_text,
                artifact_id=art_id,
                run_id=run_id,
                goal_id=goal.id,
            )
            history.append({"iter": it, "kind": "action",
                            "goal_id": goal.id, "tool": out.tool_call.name,
                            "arguments": out.tool_call.arguments,
                            "result_descriptor": result_text[:300],
                            "artifact_id": art_id})

    return final_answer_from(history)
```

## **Five observations.**

**First**, the very first thing the loop does after starting is call `memory.remember(query, ...)`. This is the durable-memory contract. When a user types "My mom's birthday is 15 May 2026," the query carries a fact that should survive into future runs. The classification call extracts that fact and persists it. Subsequent runs find it via the keyword search.

**Second**, the loop reads memory at the top of every iteration. Memory is consulted as a service.

**Third**, Perception is given the prior_goals list along with the new memory hits and the history. This is what gives goals stable identity across iterations.

**Fourth**, attachment of artifact bytes is gated on `artifacts.exists(...)`. If Perception emits an attachment handle that does not correspond to a real artifact (a hallucination), the loop silently drops it. The defence is in addition to the position-based artifact_index scheme that prevents most hallucinations at the Perception layer.

**Fifth**, when Decision returns an answer, the loop appends an `answer` event to history and continues. Perception, on the next iteration, sees the answer in history and decides whether it satisfies the current goal. Marking goals done is a Perception responsibility. Decision selects actions; it does not declare goals satisfied.

# **The gateway substrate (V3)**

Every LLM call in the four roles routes through the LLM gateway V3 at `<http://localhost:8101>`. The gateway is the same substrate Session 5 introduced, with the V3 additions described in Session 5's gateway README. The relevant features for Session 6 are summarised here.

**`auto_route` and the router pool.** When a chat request carries `auto_route="perception"`, `auto_route="memory"`, or `auto_route="decision"`, the gateway runs a small classifier LLM (the router pool) over a bounded envelope containing only the token count and a 800-character sample of the prompt. The classifier returns one of three tier labels (TINY, LARGE, HUGE). The gateway maps the tier to a worker failover order and dispatches the actual call. TINY queries land on small fast workers; LARGE queries land on long-context workers such as Gemini 3.1 flash-lite; HUGE returns 503 with a clear hint to chunk the input.

**The separation-of-concerns wall.** The router pool never sees the worker's prompt, system, tools, schema, or earlier turns. It receives only `{token_count, sample}`. The separation is enforced in code. The request envelope sent to the router LLM physically carries only the token count and the 800-character sample. The router cannot leak agentic context into routing decisions because the agentic context never reaches it.

**Provider override.** A caller can specify `provider="g"` (or any other shortcut) explicitly. The router is skipped entirely and the named provider becomes the first worker. This session uses the override on every Perception call to send Perception to Gemini. The reason was empirical: the TINY-tier worker that the router selected was too small to reliably follow Perception's multi-step procedure. The override is the gateway feature that was already designed for exactly this case.

**Structured output via `response_format`.** Perception and Memory both use this feature. The gateway translates the Pydantic JSON Schema into the per-provider response_format payload, applies the necessary cleaning for each provider, and validates the parsed output server-side. Callers receive a `parsed` dict already validated against the schema.

The diagram below summarises which role talks to which worker in the Session 6 setup.

Perception and the Memory classifier both pin to Gemini for reliability. Decision uses the router pool to pick a worker based on the size and structure of the prompt for each call.

## **Reading the gateway's honest answers**

This section is operational. It addresses a class of bugs that you will hit during your assignment and that look, on the surface, like the gateway is broken. In every case, the gateway is reporting accurately. The reality is that the underlying provider has limited what is available on the free tier.

**`reasoning_applied: false`.** When a request carries `reasoning="medium"` (for example, on a Verifier call), the gateway forwards the reasoning parameter to the worker. Some free-tier models silently ignore the parameter and return a normal completion. The gateway detects this and surfaces `reasoning_applied: false` in the response. The call itself succeeds; the reasoning knob was a no-op upstream. This is the gateway being honest about what the worker did.

Concrete example: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` on the free tier does not honour `thinkingBudget`. The gateway sets the budget, the model returns text without internal reasoning, the response contains `reasoning_applied: false`. The fix is either to live with the no-op or to upgrade to a paid-tier model that supports the knob.

**`cache_read_input_tokens: 0` and `cache_creation_input_tokens: 0`.** The `cache_system=True` flag asks the gateway to cache the system prompt. Gemini's explicit cache is available on the paid tier; on the free tier, the cache API returns a quota limit of zero and the gateway falls back to no-cache. The response shows zero cache reads and zero cache creations. The system prompt is being sent on every call.

The gateway reports this honestly. Watching the dashboard at port 8101 makes the behaviour visible: cache columns stay at zero across all calls to the Gemini worker.

**`fallback_used: true` in `router_decision`.** The gateway's router pool has four small LLMs (Cerebras llama3.1-8b, Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile, NVIDIA nemotron-nano-8b, GitHub Phi-4-mini). When all four are rate-limited, in cooldown, or returning errors, the gateway falls back to the deterministic token-count rule. The worker call still proceeds normally. The `fallback_used: true` flag in `router_decision` records that no router LLM contributed to the tier choice.

This is normal in heavy use. It is also an observability signal. A run where every iteration shows `fallback_used: true` indicates that the router pool is overloaded and the system is degrading gracefully.

**Gemini 3 loops at low temperature.** A finding from the test runs of this session: when Perception sends a structured-output request at `temperature=0`, Gemini 3.1 flash-lite sometimes emits the same output repeatedly across iterations, in a pattern that suggests internal looping. Raising the temperature to 1.0 eliminates the looping without harming output quality on the four target queries. The Session 6 implementation uses `temperature=1.0` on every Perception call for this reason.

**The principle.** The gateway never lies about what happened upstream. When a feature shows as `false` or zero in the response, the worker did not honour it. The student's task is to read the response carefully and recognise the gateway as the source of truth about what actually happened. The failure, when it occurs, originates upstream at the provider. Reading these fields on the dashboard during development is the recommended workflow.


# **Four target queries**

The remainder of this session walks through four queries that exercise different parts of the architecture. These queries are also the test cases for the assignment. Each is presented with the query text, the role progression it triggers, the expected final answer, and the observed iteration count from a clean run of `[agent.py](agent.py)`.

The traces shown below are real runs. They include the safety nets that the implementation uses (position-based artifact_index, sticky-done, force-attach for synthesis goals, Action's artifact-handle guard).

## **Query A. Shannon Wikipedia (artifact attach test)**

```
Fetch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon and tell me his
birth date, death date, and three key contributions to information
theory.
```

This query exercises the artifact attach path. The fetched Wikipedia page is roughly 250 KB of markdown. The artifact store receives the bytes; Memory records the handle; Perception identifies the second goal (extraction) as needing the bytes; the loop attaches them to Decision's prompt for that goal; Decision produces the structured answer.

```
─── iter 1 ───
[memory.read]   1 hits
[perception]    [open] Fetch the Wikipedia page for Claude Shannon
                [open] Extract birth date, death date, and three contributions

─── iter 3 ───
[perception]    [done] Fetch the Wikipedia page for Claude Shannon
                [done] Extract birth date, death date, and three contributions

[done] all 2 goals satisfied

FINAL: Birth date: April 30, 1916. Death date: February 24, 2001.
       Three key contributions: (1) A Mathematical Theory of Communication
       (1948), which established the mathematical foundations of digital
       communication; (2) introduction of the bit as the unit of information
       and the concept of entropy; (3) the Shannon limit, the theoretical
       maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a noisy
       channel.
```

Iteration count: 3. The architecture's central property appears in iter 2: Perception sees the artifact handle in the memory hits and sets `attach_artifact_id` on goal 2. The loop loads the bytes and Decision answers in one call without re-fetching.

## **Query B. Tokyo activities with weather constraint (multi-goal plus memory carryover)**

```
Find 3 family-friendly things to do in Tokyo this weekend.
Check Saturday's weather forecast there and tell me which one
is most appropriate.
```

This query has three logical goals: search for activities, fetch the weather forecast for Saturday, select an appropriate activity given the weather. The memory carryover happens between goals two and three: the weather fact recorded by Action is read by Decision when reasoning about which activity fits.

```
─── iter 1 ───
[perception]    [open] Find 3 family-friendly things to do in Tokyo
                [open] Check Saturday's weather in Tokyo
                [open] Choose the most appropriate activity given the weather
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: web_search({"query": "family-friendly things to do in Tokyo this weekend"})
[action]        → [3 results returned, descriptors recorded]

─── iter 2 ───
[perception]    [done] Find 3 family-friendly things to do in Tokyo
                [open] Check Saturday's weather in Tokyo
                [open] Choose the most appropriate activity given the weather
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: fetch_url({"url": "https://wttr.in/Tokyo?format=...&Saturday"})
[action]        → Saturday forecast: patchy rain, 18C

─── iter 3 ───
[perception]    [done] Find 3 family-friendly things to do in Tokyo
                [done] Check Saturday's weather in Tokyo
                [open] Choose the most appropriate activity given the weather
[decision]      ANSWER: Given Saturday's patchy rain forecast, an indoor
                activity is recommended. From the three options found
                (Ueno Zoo, Tsukiji Outer Market sushi class, Tokyo Skytree),
                the Tsukiji sushi class is most appropriate because it is
                fully indoors and family-oriented.

[done] all 3 goals satisfied
```

Iteration count: 6 in the observed run including some web-search refinement. Memory carries the weather fact from iter 2 into Decision's context in iter 3 through the keyword search at the top of each iteration.

## **Query C. Mom's birthday (durable memory across two runs)**

```
Run 1: My mom's birthday is 15 May 2026. Remember that and give me
       a calendar reminder for two weeks before and on the day.

Run 2: When is mom's birthday?
```

This query exercises the durable-memory contract. The first run classifies the user's statement at the very top of `[agent6.run](agent6.run)``(...)` via `memory.remember(...)`, producing a `fact` item with the date and entity extracted. Run 1 then creates reminder files in the sandbox via `create_file`. Run 2, executed against the same `state/` directory, finds the fact through the keyword search and answers directly.

Run 1 trace (abbreviated):

```
[memory.remember]  classified "Mom's birthday is 15 May 2026" as fact
                   keywords: ["mom", "birthday", "may", "2026"]

─── iter 1 ───
[perception]    [open] Remember mom's birthday (15 May 2026)
                [open] Create a reminder for 1 May 2026 (two weeks before)
                [open] Create a reminder for 15 May 2026
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: create_file({"path": "reminders/mom_birthday_2026.txt", ...})
[action]        → ok

... two more iterations creating the reminders ...

FINAL: Reminders created. Mom's birthday on 15 May 2026 is recorded.
```

`state/memory.json` after run 1 contains a fact item with kind="fact", keywords mentioning birthday/mom/may, value containing the date.

Run 2 trace:

```
─── iter 1 ───
[memory.read]   1 hits
                fact: "Mom's birthday is on 15 May 2026"
[perception]    [open] Answer when mom's birthday is
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: list_dir({"path": "reminders/"})
[action]        → [file: mom_birthday_2026.txt]

─── iter 2 ───
[memory.read]   2 hits
[perception]    [done] Answer when mom's birthday is
[decision]      ANSWER: Mom's birthday is on 15 May 2026.

[done] all 1 goals satisfied
```

Iteration count: 4 for run 1, 2 for run 2. The fact is carried across run boundaries by the persistent `state/memory.json` file.

## **Query D. Asyncio research (multi-source synthesis)**

```
Search for 'Python asyncio best practices', read the top 3 results,
and give me a short numbered list of the advice they agree on.
```

This query exercises multi-artifact attachment. The agent performs a web search, fetches each of the top three results (producing three artifacts), and then Perception attaches the relevant ones to a synthesis goal. Decision reads the attached content and produces a consolidated list.

```
─── iter 1 ───
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: web_search({"query": "Python asyncio best practices"})
[action]        → [3 URLs in descriptors]

─── iter 2 ───
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: fetch_url({"url": "https://result1..."})
[action]        → [artifact art:abc1, 45KB]

─── iter 3 ───
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: fetch_url({"url": "https://result2..."})
[action]        → [artifact art:abc2, 38KB]

─── iter 4 ───
[decision]      TOOL_CALL: fetch_url({"url": "https://result3..."})
[action]        → [artifact art:abc3, 51KB]

─── iter 5 ───
[perception]    [done] Search
                [done] Fetch top 3 results
                [open] Synthesise common advice
                  attach=art:abc1   (Perception picks the most recent
                                     synthesis-relevant artifact)
[attach]        art:abc1 (45KB)
[decision]      ANSWER:
                1. Use asyncio.run() as the program entry point
                2. Prefer asyncio.gather and asyncio.TaskGroup over manual
                   awaits when running multiple coroutines concurrently
                3. Avoid blocking calls in async code; use asyncio.to_thread()
                   for CPU-bound or blocking I/O
                4. Use timeouts on every external call to prevent hangs
                5. Limit concurrency with semaphores when calling rate-limited
                   external services
```

Iteration count: 5 to 7 depending on how many results the agent decides to fetch. Perception's force-attach safety net kicks in for synthesis goals: when the first unfinished goal contains synthesis keywords (synthesise, extract, list, compare, decide) and an artifact exists in memory hits, the implementation attaches the most recent artifact automatically. This guard reduces dependence on the model's reasoning about which artifact is relevant.
